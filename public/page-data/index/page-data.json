Using the React Native framework, Expo platform for Android/iOS support, Google Firebase backend, and Twilio's text API, our app focused on facilitating meetings between fellow Bruins as donors and donees of meal swipes. We hope to release it once campus reopens.","Order":"1"},{"Name":"2020 NBA Playoff Predictions","Image":["https://i.imgur.com/LEsqb4t.png"],"Summary":"As part of a 3-person team for Bruin Sports Analytics, I predicted every playoff series outcome - 1st round to championships - if the NBA regular season ended when quarantine began. We used logistic regression and Monte Carlo techniques on the past 5 years of data to build a capable Excel model aligning with many experts' opinions. Regular season win and offensive efficient field goal (OEFG) percentages proved the most compelling variables.

Continuous sensor fusion from the infrared LED phototransistor array on the RSLK's underbelly produced real-time error values from the path center, which could be used by a C++ Proportional-Derivative control to determine appropriate steering. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e1_dyBYTtLYQjGUNXawhgov_kPMuDyC0cpPLgbZJ52Q/edit?usp=sharing\">Read the full report here</a> for a complete explanation.","Order":"3"},{"Name":"Kontagion","Image":["https://i.imgur.com/rgEMwpq.png"],"Summary":"As Project 3 of UCLA's CS 32 course, I built the videogame Kontagion. The whimsical premise: Socrates Nguyen, the world's best janitor ever, agrees to shrink to a microscopic size to fight Dr. Evyl's formidable bacteria army. Testing mastery of C++ pointers and memory allocation as well as OOP concepts like inheritance and abstract classes, this project was very fulfilling. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/deanjones-git/Kontagion\">See the code here</a>.","Order":"4"},{"Name":"Goober Eats","Image":["https://i.imgur.com/8FvoCdj.png"],"Summary":"As Project 4 of UCLA's CS 32 course, I wrote the algorithm behind Goober Eats, a fictional company seeking to revolutionize the food delivery industry with robot workers. Each street on Google Maps can be thought of as a series of linear segments connecting various geocoordinates - this project hoped to optimize deliveries for such geocoordinates in the Westwood area. Two well-known and powerful techniques were implemented: the A* search algorithm to find the most efficient route between two points and simulated annealing for determining the best order to hit each stop. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/deanjones-git/Goober-Eats\">See the code here</a>.","Order":"5"},{"Name":"Nova Website","Image":["https://i.imgur.com/D2tlm3p.jpg"],"Summary":"Testing my newfound knowledge of React and ongoing learning of the Gatsby framework, I successfully built Nova's website from scratch and established its link to a Notion CMS with the help of a couple useful Gatsby plugins. I could only have achieved this with the consistently great feedback and stellar creative vision from Nova's designers and frequent code proofreading by fellow developers. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.novaforgood.org/\">Visit us here</a>.","Order":"6"}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
